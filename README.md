! Don't forget to install MongoDB as Windows Service which allow MongoDB not close or sleep. You can use the following configuration file(In C:/mongod.cfg). The most important is bindIp! We need to set it to 0.0.0.0 to allow access from public IP.

```
systemLog:
    destination: file
    path: c:\data\log\mongod.log
storage:
    dbPath: c:\data\db

net:
   bindIp: 0.0.0.0
   port: 27017
```


! Set Firewall in Windows. Put Mongod.exe in the safe list.

When finish intall MongoDB and run it. And create a user you like using following code:
```
db.createUser(
  {
    user: "tdmuser",
    pwd: "12345678",
    roles: [ { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "tdm" } ]
  }
)
```
